    Learning Objective:
    To develop positive thinking
    Developing a positive attitude
    Positive Mental Attitude: The prerequisite to
    winning!
    A positive attitude, or outlook on life, can lead to positive
    behavior and create success. An upbeat, positive person draws
    other people like a magnet. After all, who would you rather be
    around—someone who is strong and motivated, with the
    confidence to keep moving forward; or, someone who stays
    stuck in one place, thinking of reasons why things don’t seem
    to happen? No arguments!
    Consider this list of positive habits.
    I will think of myself as Successful!
    I will have positive expectations for everything I do!
    I will remind myself of past successes!
    I will not dwell on failures...I just won’t repeat them!
    I will surround myself with positive people and ideas!
    I will keep trying until I achieve the results  I want!
    List of excuses
    These detract from optimum performance:
    • I didn’t have time to practice
    • I don’t understand the tasks
    • I don’t have the best glider
    • The tasks are too daunting
    • I’ve got a terrible headache
    • I can’t get focused today
• I can’t deal with the pressure
• This contest isn’t important to me
• I don’t have a clear frequency
• I can’t beat him
• I don’t like to compete
A common thread that connects these excuses
Actually there are two:
The bad news — Negative Thinking
The good news — all can be corrected with Positive Action.
Excuses pre-exist in our minds; they are really a reflection of our
commitment or resolve, or lack thereof. These barriers are
nothing more than our mind giving our body permission to
fail — they’re a pre-existing justification for poor performance!
Something as simple making your own Top Twenty-Excuse
list can be used as a powerful tool. Scan that list and see how
many of those obstructions may be holding you back. Take
each of the impediments on your personal list and decide how
it can be corrected, reversed, or even turned into an asset. Next,
decide if you’re committed enough to make the invariable
sacrifices that are necessary for legitimate improvement.
He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand
and walk and run...
Step 1:
Accept Responsibility
When people accept additional responsibility they are actually
giving themselves a promotion.
Responsible behavior is to accept accountability. That represents
maturity. Acceptance of responsibility is a reflection of our
attitude and the environment we operate in. Most people are
quick to take credit for what goes right but very few would
readily accept responsibility when things go wrong. A person
who does not accept responsibility is not absolved from being
responsible. Your objective is to cultivate responsible behavior.
Stop the Blame Game
Avoid phrases such as:
· Everyone else does it,
· No one does it, or
· It is all your fault.
People who don’t accept responsibility shift the blame to their
parents, teachers and genes. God, fate, luck or the stars.
Responsible behavior should be inculcated right from childhood. It cannot be taught without a certain degree of
obedience.
